# Tutor Lama ðŸ¦™

Tutor Lama is a web app for connecting tutors with students who go to the same university.

## Installation and Setup

### Facebook

Tutor Lama uses Facebook for user registration and authentication. After registering a project at developers.facebook.com, add environment variables to your deployment environment so Tutor Lama can make calls to the Facebook API.

```bash
export FACEBOOK_KEY=<your-facebook-app-id>
export FACEBOOK_SECRET=<your-facebook-secret>
```

In order to use the Facebook JavaScript SDK, Tutor Lama MUST be deployed on an SSL server. For a local development Ruby server with SSL support out-of-the-box, it's recommended to use [thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin)

Create an SSL certificate and key in the main project directory -- named localhost.crt and localhost.key, respectively -- and then start up the Ruby web server with:
```bash
thin start --ssl --ssl-key-file localhost.key --ssl-cert-file localhost.crt
```

### App Dependencies
